				Creed
			</p>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				 I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my live in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state and nation better places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals.Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.

				Competitions
			</p>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				The Technology Student Association hosts annual competitions where school chapters compete in a variety of STEM based events and showcase their projects for first, second, and third place. During the month of February a regional conference is held where school chapters meet and compete against other chapters in their region. This conference decides which students qualify to move onto the state level competing against chapters throughout the state. In Pennsylvania TSA this conference is a 3 day event in early April held at Seven Springs Resort. If students compete well at States chapters have the opportunity to go and compete on the highest level, nationals. The national conference consists of chapters throughout the United States and even international countries of Turkey, Greece, and Japan. Last yearâ€™s national conference was held at a beautiful resort in Orlando, Florida. The conference not only allows the students to compete at a high level but also to meet new people outside their small community and develop new friendships.
