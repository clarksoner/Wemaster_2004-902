				Banks have improved so much through AI. Many people today are busy and unfortunately can not travel to the bank to deposit a check. Therefore, online banking apps were introduced  with the ability to deposit checks, check balances, and review previous transactions. With the incorporation of AI, the database can observe the customer’s transaction patterns and more effectively identify suspicious purchases. It also increases the options available to the customers. For example, Discover Card has introduced a new feature that allows customers to “freeze” their account if their card is lost, blocking any new purchases but they remain able to pay recurring bill payments. In addition, many companies are utilizing chatbots to notify customers and provide aid in customer service to leave human assistance for complicated problems and reduced wait time. One of the largest banking companies, Bank of America unveiled an artificially intelligent chatbot Erica. Erica provides customers with notifications, savings, updates of FICO scores, and simplifies online bill payments. Although she currently is unavailable to customers, many are excited for her anticipated arrival. Eno, from Capital One, is another chatbot that was incorporated with Amazon Alexa last year. Now Capital One customers have the option to check upcoming bills, account balances, and pay credit card from a simple voice activation.

				Social Media has become a large part of our culture with 81% of US Americans with a social media profile from Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. With new information being uploaded every second throughout the world, it is difficult for social media marketing specialists to follow the many patterns and trends of social media. AI is aiding companies with content creation, consumer intelligence, customer service, influencer marketing, and content optimization. A social content platform, called Twizoo utilizes AI in content creation. In this partnership, it allows companies to immediately recognize and incorporate media content on a website. According to Lux Narayan, CEO of Unmetric, an AI-powered social media metrics company, he compares consumer intelligence to, “pulling out the needles from the haystack,  filtering out signals from noise and finding interesting relevant signals for a brand that it can take forward into actionable insights”. Companies are combating this problem with programs like Converseon. Converseon is a virtual consultant that utilizes machine-learning to observe social and voice-of-customer-data, highlighting meaningful data in the constant addition of new information. In customer service, chatbots such as Conversocial enable people to easily find help relevant to their problems, besides the generic Help buttons that almost never have an answer to your problem, through social channels. Influencer marketing is an important in social media as Narayan states, “It's imperative that brands have more intelligence into how they associate with certain influencers, making sure that they're a fit for the brand’s DNA.” To find the perfect match companies are incorporating a platform known as InsightPool,that searching from over 600 million influencers with a higher match rate than pure human pairings. The New York Times has created Blossom to increase content optimization by scanning thousands of odd articles to find what audiences showed the most interest toward and promote for a larger article.

				Smart personal assistants are also becoming very popular because of AI. These assistants can give you reminders about plans or meetings, they can answer any questions, play music, and order items online. These assistants provide helpful aid to companies allowing tasks to be completed quickly and efficiently. For example, Instead of wasting time writing events on a calendar one can simply asks these assistants to remember the date and remind you. Many companies are embracing this new opportunity. Apple created Siri on October 4, 2011, this was one of the first smart personal assistants . Siri’s capabilities include, calling people, texting people, playing music, and doing many more things.The company Amazon recently released with the Amazon Echo in 2014. Echo is synced with the customer’s Amazon account providing easy access to music and online shopping. In 2015 alone, Amazon sold more than 11 million Echos. Google began utilizing this technology in the Google Home which can control different facilities in a house such as lighting and temperature in addition the abilities of its competitors. Overall, many consumers are overjoyed about these computerized personal assistants, due to their capability of simple voice activation to complete a task in seconds without forcing consumers to leave the comfort of their home.

				Artificial Intelligence has become implemented in transportation throughout the country in many well known companies.  One popular car service, Uber, incorporated AI and Machine Learning to more efficiently transport customers from point A to point B. Uber has high hopes for the future by utilizing this new technology, predicting rider demand of “surge pricing”, and statics on optimal pickup locations. Surging prices are a problematic occurrence as occasionally, the limited amount of drivers can not fulfill the consumer demand resulting in a sharp price increase for a short period of time. With machine learning, Uber can  predict which times have statistically shown to be the busiest and compensate with a larger amount of drivers, resulting in a more profitable company. This predicting program can also be utilized in similar situations for UberEats. In 2014, Uber began partnering with restaurants to create an online food ordering and delivery platform. Likewise in Uber’s car service, Uber Eats AI has the ability to identify which times are the busiest, schedule more workers to handle massive increase in consumer demand, decrease the time for meal delivery, and create a larger profit.
				<br><br>
				In addition to AI advancements in car transportation but also commercial airlines to improve operational efficacy, speed and customer satisfaction. The number one airline, American Airlines, have made a large push toward this new technology by developing an app allows customers to detect the luggage size and prepay for additional expenses before stepping foot in the airport. Delta Airplanes also hopped on the bandwagon with their creation of automated self-service bag checking in May of 2017. These new kiosks utilize facial recognition technology for identity verification as well as match luggage to their owners. Although AI does not have the advancements to pilot a plane, many new opportunities to help customers have a successful flight experience.
				<br><br>
				Companies are utilizing Artificial Intelligence to better cater to consumer needs by reviewing past interests or purchases. One example is Google News, which pairs geolocation with AI to provide customers with stories aligning with their location and recent interests. Amazon utilizes previous customer interests to create product recommendations based from items previously purchased, displaying products of similar styles to previously bought items that might interest the customers. Siri incorporates machine learning and voice recognition to adapt to the customers needs and commands such as buying the usual dog food when told the dog food is gone, or perhaps when dinner is ready turning on a certain music playlist. The possibilities are endless.
				<br></br>
				Many are excited about the news of “Just Walk Out Technology” in stores such as Amazon Go that allows customers to simply put an item in a bag and walk out. This new E-commerce technology utilizes artificial intelligence and cameras to track items that customers pick off the shelves and instantly charging it to their Amazon account. First, customers download the Amazon Go app, link it with a pay method, and scan their account at one of the kisokos. Then consumers simply place their desired items in a bag. When customers leave they walk through scanners that identify and charges the item to the customers corresponding Amazon account in the large AI database. The first Amazon Go store was developed in Seattle Washington. Customers were overjoyed with no checkout lines and the ability to pick an item off the shelve and simply walk out. This “Just Walk Out Technology” is becoming an international sensation with similar stores in China called BingoBox soon opening 200 stores across 29 cities throughout the country.

				Many sports teams are now using Artificial Intelligence .  Alan Fern, an Oregon State University researcher is trying to teach computers how to understand football and the coaches plays. This is very big because if these computers can understand football then it will help the coach know exactly what each player needs to work on. This also allows each player to know exactly what they need to work on in order to improve.Also, if a coach is unable to coach a game for some reason then the computer will be able to tell the players what to do in order to win, if it knows how to do all of the plays and understands the game.

				The Soul Machine Baby X is a virtual baby that is part of a project led by award winning Dr. Mark Sagar to develop, “intelligent, emotionally responsive avatars that can learn and react just like you”. The virtual baby acts similar to humans with its responses, learning, and expression. For example, when the viewer holds up a picture baby will focus on the picture and pronounce the word for the picture. Sagar was excited to undertake this challenge of creating “ultimate animation”, a character that could produce independent actions based on its own digital consciousness. This knowledge can then be applied to augmented/virtual reality video games to improve the behavior of autonomous characters. Sagar utilized computical models theoretical functions of the brain, biomechanically- based model of the face, and “Brain Language” controlling speech, and reaction to voice and visual stimulus. This causes Baby X to portray movement closely mimicking that of a human. Although Baby X’s technology is still developing , Sagar has high expectations announcing the potential of full body avatars in 12 months to aid in human’s day-to-day lifestyle.
