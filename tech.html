				Banks have improved so much through AI. Many people today are busy and they can not make it to the bank to deposit their checks. To solve this problem many banks have created apps so people can do online banking. With these apps people can deposit checks, check their balances, and even see all of the transactions that they made. Since the banks are now using mobile banking apps this is allowing them to get more customers since it is easy to use and the customer can access multiple accounts at once. These apps are not making the customers pay anything to use these apps. Most banks are making mobile banking for any type of phones. With the customers being able to see all f their transactions they are able to keep track of their money and make sure that no one is taking money out of their account without them knowing.

				Many teenagers today have at least one social media account. Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook are very popular forms of Artificial Intelligence. Social media allows people to share pictures of what they are doing or even just allowing them to share their opinions on certain topics. These allow people to communicate even if they are not looking at each other face to face. This allows someone that is from one country to talk to someone in a completely different country. Social media is changing this world in a good way because of AI.
				<br><br>
				Smart personal assistants are also becoming very popular. These assistants can give you reminders about plans or meetings, they can answer any questions that you have, they can play your music, they can even order stuff online. These assistants very helpful for companies because this allows them to quickly do things in a matter of seconds. Instead of writing each individual event on a calendar you are able to just say it to these assistants and it will remember it. Amazon came out with the Amazon Echo, more than 11 million Echos were sold since June 23, 2015. Apple as their own version of a smart personal assistant, Siri. Siri is only for Apple users, and she got introduced on October 4, 2011. Another example could be the Google Home which came out on November 4, 2016.

				Commerical Uses
			</p>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				One well known car service, Uber, incorporated AI and Machine Learning to allow their customers to book a taxi to get from point A to point B. Uber has high hopes for the future by utilizing this new technology, predicting rider demand of “surge pricing”, meal delivery times of UberEats, and statics on optimal pickup locations. Surging prices are a problematic occurrence where they is not enough drivers to meet the increased customer demand causing sharp price increases for a short period of time. By machine learning predicting ahead of time which times have shown to be the busiest time the price surges will be avoided and Uber more profitable. This predicting program can also be utilized in similar situations for UberEats, identifying which times are the busiest, schedule more workers to handle to massive increase in consumer demand, decrease the time for meal delivery, and create a larger profit.

				In addition for AI technology being utilized to improve transport in cars but also in commercial airline. Commercial airlines are using artificial intelligence autopilots. Today most airplanes only need to be human operated for 7 minutes. This is a very good idea because now airplanes do not need to have 2 pilots on the planes, they really only need one person on board but just incase they have 2 people on. Artificial Intelligence on planes can cause a lot of problems to because if the plane ends up having some trouble the the pilot will need to take the wheel to fix the problem. 
				<br><br>
				Companies are using Artificial Intelligence to utilize the consumers location to provide information or products. Google News uses locate to provide the customer with local news relevant to a specific area. For example, if someone lives in Georgia then it will show news that is relevant to Georgia residents rather than news within Pennsylvania. Amazon uses previous customer interests to create product recommendations based from items previously purchased, recommending certain styles or items. Siri incorporates machine learning and voice recognition to adapt to the customers needs and commands such as buying the usual dog food when Siri is told the dog food is gone, or perhaps when dinner is ready turning on a certain music playlist. The possibilities are endless.

				Many sports teams are now using Artificial Intelligence .  Alan Fern, an Oregon State University researcher is trying to teach computers how to understand football and the coaches plays. This is very big because if these computers can understand football then it will help the coach know exactly what each player needs to work on. This also allows each player to know exactly what they need to work on in order to improve.Also, if a coach is unable to coach a game for some reason then the computer will be able to tell the players what to do in order to win, if it knows how to do all of the plays and understands the game.
