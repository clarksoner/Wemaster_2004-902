				 Artificial Intelligence has opened many different opportunities in making our lives easier by recommending the best options and predicting future trends based on previous data. AI has the potential for improving healthcare, social services, financial services and public safety. Take a closer look at the effects of incorporating Artificial Intelligence in these fields.
				<br><br>
				In healthcare, developers are experimenting with AI to decide which treatment options is best suited to a patient based on previous medical history, effectiveness on previous patients, and relevant medical practices. This application of AI would give the patient the most efficient, and safest treatment allowing for higher recovery rate. In addition to treatment options, Artificial Intelligence has the ability share vast amounts of data on a larger scale. Currently, few hospitals have the capability to fully share electronic medical records preventing data sharing on a national level. By incorporating AI systems, it would enable open communication of data throughout America, instantly linking patients to doctors and available treatments. Lastly, is implementing Artificial Intelligence in medical imaging, specifically in Radiology. AI machine learning has the ability to give a diagnosis based on an image, segment a tumor, provide clinical decision support, and improve machine generated images. This is achieved by “training” the machines, displaying examples of normal or pathological images repeatedly until the machine is able to differentiate between it and identify a diagnosis. Many doctors are distressed about the increasing applications of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare and its substitution for human jobs. Mark Michalski, director of the Center of Clinical Data Science in Massachusetts General Hospital, explains, “There are things that Artificial Intelligence does well, and things it does not do well at all. So the best option is a marriage of both human and computer capabilities”.
				<br><br>
				In social services, robotic process automation (RPA) and cognitive technologies make it more efficient for the caseworkers and the individual's receiving the much needed resources. One future application of AI is improving efficiency in the eligibility verification process. Currently, caseworkers utilize multiple systems and manually verify the individual's eligibility. The RPA software has the ability to simply this process by connecting the systems, automatically searching the verification field, and opening relevant documents, drastically decreasing the time of the verification process. AI also has future potential to improve fraud detection. With machine learning, the computer learns to flag applications for fraud, utilizing human feedback and improving its accuracy over time.  Furthermore, machine learning can be utilized to predict high-risk cases, specifically in child welfare. The program takes into consideration many factors such as, intergenerational abuse, young parents, mental health problems, presence of a child under the age of three, and history of substance abuse. When the program flags a high-risk case a detailed investigation is completed and the staff discusses the solutions to remove the risk. The machine learning programs allows for the field staff to target investigations on risk rather than random sampling.

				If you want more content on your pages, just copy paste the text blocks. There are two parts to a text block - the header and the content. They're both surrounded by P tags. You're smart you can figure it out I think.
