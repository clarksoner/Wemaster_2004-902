				 Artificial Intelligence has opened many different opportunities in making our lives easier by recommending the best options and predicting future trends based on previous data. AI has the potential for improving healthcare, social services, financial services and public safety. Take a closer look at the effects of incorporating Artificial Intelligence in these fields.
				<br><br>
				In healthcare, developers are experimenting with AI to decide which treatment options is best suited to a patient based on previous medical history, effectiveness on previous patients, and relevant medical practices. This application of AI would give the patient the most efficient, and safest treatment allowing for higher recovery rate. In addition to treatment options, Artificial Intelligence has the ability share vast amounts of data on a larger scale. Currently, few hospitals have the capability to fully share electronic medical records preventing data sharing on a national level. By incorporating AI systems, it would enable open communication of data throughout America, instantly linking patients to doctors and available treatments. Lastly, is implementing Artificial Intelligence in medical imaging, specifically in Radiology. AI machine learning has the ability to give a diagnosis based on an image, segment a tumor, provide clinical decision support, and improve machine generated images. This is achieved by “training” the machines, displaying examples of normal or pathological images repeatedly until the machine is able to differentiate between it and identify a diagnosis. Many doctors are distressed about the increasing applications of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare and its substitution for human jobs. Mark Michalski, director of the Center of Clinical Data Science in Massachusetts General Hospital, explains, “There are things that Artificial Intelligence does well, and things it does not do well at all. So the best option is a marriage of both human and computer capabilities”.
				<br><br>
				In social services, robotic process automation (RPA) and cognitive technologies make it more efficient for the caseworkers and the individual's receiving the much needed resources. One future application of AI is improving efficiency in the eligibility verification process. Currently, caseworkers utilize multiple systems and manually verify the individual's eligibility. The RPA software has the ability to simply this process by connecting the systems, automatically searching the verification field, and opening relevant documents, drastically decreasing the time of the verification process. AI also has future potential to improve fraud detection. With machine learning, the computer learns to flag applications for fraud, utilizing human feedback and improving its accuracy over time.  Furthermore, machine learning can be utilized to predict high-risk cases, specifically in child welfare. The program takes into consideration many factors such as, intergenerational abuse, young parents, mental health problems, presence of a child under the age of three, and history of substance abuse. When the program flags a high-risk case a detailed investigation is completed and the staff discusses the solutions to remove the risk. The machine learning programs allows for the field staff to target investigations on risk rather than random sampling.
				<br><br>
				Artificial Intelligence is opening many barriers in public safety in machine vision, crime, and investigations. Machine vision is the use of sensors, processing hardware, and algorithms to replicate the human’s ability to see. When machine vision is utilized for surveillance the detection of anomalies in crime increases, allowing policing to specifically target criminals and uses the appropriate force. Another advantage to using computer programs is no bias based decisions which is a common problem faced with animosities based on religion, race, ethnicity, age, gender, economic class, and social status. Furthermore, a common problem in surveillance is low quality video leading poor identification and lack of manpower to observe massive amounts of footage. AI will solve all these problems with higher quality of video, leading it higher level of identification, and as discussed earlier, efficient automatic processing to easily detect anomalies. A third new possibility is predictive policing. This incorporates machine learning to predict where, when, and whom has the higher probability of committing a crime. Many are wary of predictive policing as it does not have concrete evidence to accuse someone of a crime. Although, in the future of AI could reduce or remove human bias basing it, rather, off of facts and statistics.

				Commercial Uses
			</p>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				 The use of Artificial Intelligence in commercial applications is perhaps the most well known. sending the media in a frenzy with prototypes of driverless cars and computer recommended items. The following paragraphs will discuss in greater detail different ways businesses are including Artificial Intelligence. 
				<br><br>
				The potential of Artificial Intelligence in transportation in unlimited to improve the efficiency of transportation systems. One controversial example of this is the driver assistance vehicles built with semi-automated features. Many claim that driverless vehicles will make roads safer, decreasing deaths each year from about 6 million to 1.3 million. By removing human error in driving and replacing it with autonomous drivers not only lead to less crashes but less traffic congestion as well. Another advantage to autonomous cars is the fuel efficiency for acceleration and braking which is predicted to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions by 300 million tons per year. This potential is huge for environmentalist that encourage a change to decreasing the rate of global warming. 
				<br><br>
				AI applications in E-commerce are providing companies with more ways to attract and retain customers. One new option is visual search, a technology that allows customers to take a picture of an item that they desire, whether it be in a magazine or at a party, and companies find an item similar to the picture that the customer can purchase. By allowing the individual to easily find the piece and providing easy access to buy the item can be a large boost in product sales. In addition to visual search AI applications pave the way for voice search to understand spoken commands giving customers the ability to buy something without leaving the comfort of their home or logging on to the computer. Voice searches are especially becoming incorporated in voice assistants such as Alexa and Siri providing a larger range of functions. Another option in development is online personal shoppers. This technology utilizes AI to collect data on the customer’s shopping habitats and personal taste which is then used to “recommend” other purchases that the customer would find interesting. Lastly, marketing campaigns paired  with  AI technologies known as neural networks. These networks give companies feedback on advertisements based on prior experience, identified patterns, and predicted trends to demonstrate which marketing tactics were effective and which tactics need improvement.

				Educational Uses
			</p>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				Many teachers are bogged down by grading papers rather than focusing on teaching. AI can be utilized to reduce the amount of time spent on grading papers allowing teachers more time spent on increasing student interaction with in-class activities, establishing a stronger sense of understanding for the students. Current technologies have the ability to answer multiple choice questions by scanning a bubble sheet and marking which answers do not match the answer sheet but, written responses remain human graded. There are computer programs such as Go My Access that teachers utilize as an easy way for students to practice writing and grammar skills. Students submit their writing through the computer and it intanteousely provides a score and feedback on structure and grammar errors. This program is a great tool... when it works. There are many cheats on the program as the computer can not fully understand the writing as well as humans. This results in false feedback for the student’s work providing no improvement on necessary writing skills. Improvements on these programs are in the experimental process to hopefully become a common tool for educators to easily see skills that students are struggling with and receiving the resources to improve.
				<br><br>
				AI tutors have become embraced in the education system. The computer tutors aid students in basic lessons of mathematics, writing, and other subjects but struggle in areas of higher learning. Many students complain that the computers flounder when attempting to relay complex lessons making it very hard for them to understand or ask questions, compared to human teachers. The bright future of AI advancements hopes to improve the tutors in higher level learning to provide students with additional support in difficult subjects. The future also holds the potential for these tutors to teach in a virtual classroom, holding the opportunity for people to learn at anywhere and any time of the day. 
				<br><br>
				In some career paths, experimenting with different materials is imperative in mastering the skill, but the materials are too expensive for every student to experiment in order to be accustomed with it. AI, along with virtual reality, provides a solution through creating a digital workshop where the materials mimic real actions, allowing Trial and Error experiments for students to learn without wasting large amounts of money on wasted materials. In addition to unlimited supply of resources online, students are able to demonstrate creativity in a judgement free zone away from intimidating eyes of classmates and teachers. 
				<br><br>
				Feedback is a large part of improvement in any field, so what is the difference when the that feedback originated from a computer? With AI’s ability to quickly analyze data it makes it very easy to provide professors with an evaluation of a individual student or an entire class’s performance providing feedback to improve the course by spending more time on a commonly misunderstood lesson to create a better understanding. AI can also offer feedback toward students to recommend which classes or career is best suited for their interest or passions. A second opinion to narrow down the large amount of career options for young overwhelmed students is one of the most helpful feedback.

				Recreational Uses
			</p>
			
			<p class="bodyText1">
				When scientists mention artificial intelligence programs in recreation, people commonly think of video games, which is barely scraping the surface of the unlimited possibilities. Surprising applications in sports and music shows that AI is more than a passing trend that is here to stay. 
				<br><br>
				With advancements in technology also come advancements in gaming world, and artificial intelligence is no different. One of the largest video game creators, Unity, is experimenting ideas with the help of AI to improve first-person shooters and role-playing games.  One new idea incorporates new programs that reduce game-development time from weeks to just hours with the introduction of machine learning and reinforcement learning. Machine Learning not only has the ability to learn and adapt quickly based on prior experience, but teach each other as well. Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents) are an open source tool that trains other intelligent agents in false environments based on games or real-life simulations. This application is especially useful for large-scale training of autonomous vehicles and robotics, game development for computerized characters with unique behavior and engaging interactions, and observing complex multivariable behavior in realistic scenarios.
				<br><br>
				Many fields are becoming revolutionized with the introduction of artificial intelligence,chatbots, and machine learning. Sports is becoming redesigned with AI’s promising future. One sport enhancement is AI assistant coaches. Unfortunately, coaching is a skill that requires a vast amount of time and experience to master but, with AI’s helpful statistics, game strategies can be provided in seconds. Coaches have unlimited amount of information at their fingertips of analyzing common mistakes, improving plays, and recommendations for the best matchups. Although these computers will never be able to overtake human coaching, multiple different opinions can create new and improved strategies and ideas. One sport enhancement for fans are smart tickets. The smart tickets open the possibility for fans to change seats between games. Rather than be secluded to one seat during the entire game, fans will have to option to move around, spend one quarter with the family but then move to an area with more energetic fans sharing common interests. Another sport enhancement was introduced with IBM Watson announced of future plans to incorporate automated video highlights during the popular Wimbledon Tennis Conference. The new future plans include a computerized chatbot “Ask Fred” for fan’s questions, quickly transporting video highlights chosen by data from the spectators cheers and reactions to the match, and effectively protects against potential cyber security threats. Lastly, a developing artificial intelligence technology in sports is computer vision. Computer vision has the potential to reduce judging calls made by referees, calling shots in or out based on detected speed and direction. This is technology is specifically developed in Tennis, placing a device on the net post, utilizing computer vision to detect if the shot was in the boundaries, and signaling to the player with light and sounds. Many other up-and-coming AI sensors are incorporated in clothing and equipment to collect data and recommend performance improvements.

				Research Uses
			<p>
				
			<p class="bodyText1">
				With ground-breaking discoveries in personal, commercial, educational, recreational applications it is no surprise that artificial technology advancements have been revolutionizing research. AI has the ability to collect and store greater data than any database before. This ability generates the perfect program for space exploration to the corners of the universe, or quickly identify rare space phenomenons, or compose a virtual scientist. Continue reading for an explanation on the unlimited possibilities.
				<br><br>
				Space exploration has been limited by human astronauts due to the vast amount of time that is required for deep space exploration which exceeds the average human lifespan. Technology currently lacks the advancements to send humans through space in hyperspeed, so an alternative solution was developed, AI and automated probes. These machine learning probes are a perfect solution since deep space exceeds the range of wireless communications forcing the probes to learn and adapt to unforeseen environments without human aid. Artificial Intelligence has previously been incorporated in the Spirit and Opportunity rovers in 2003. These rovers consisted of autonomous driving systems known as Autonav to explore Mars’ rocky surface. The current Mar rover, Curiosity, also has a similar program known as AEGIS, Autonomous Exploration of Gathering Increased Science, which analyzes and records interesting aspects of Mars with others scientists still on earth. AEGIS has a vast amount of potential which go beyond the current capabilities of inspecting Mars’ surface. Although the future of AI in deep space exploration is bright there are obstacles scientists must address. One consideration is the probes power source. In the frigid temperatures of deep space the probe must be able to function by holding its valuable heat.  A battery must also be developed to function over long travels with easy rechargeability. The second consideration is the discovery of a new object. To fully understand this new object additional test must be run that may not have been expected. The ability for the robot to adapt and run additional tests on its composition, movements, and interacts is important for a fuller understanding of the new discovery.The last major obstacle is communication delays. For a message to travel from Earth to Pluto takes five hours which is problematic when the probes must make a split second decision.  The probes ability to self-think and make these quick decisions to save itself and the mission, is imperative when human aid is unattainable. 
				<br><br>
				In addition to probes on Mars, AI is also being incorporated in astronomy research. Phenomenons called gravitational lens in space are when a galaxy or black hole is between a distant light source and Earth which causes a bend the space and light around it. Gravitational lens are important because it develops a lens that astronomers can utilize to look at distant parts of the universe that is usually blocked, providing astronomers with a deeper understanding of the universe’s composition. Finding gravitational lens are difficult as they are extremely rare in the vast universe, one in every 30,000 galaxies. Therefore, Carlo Enrico Petrillo and his colleagues developed an AI system to sort through the terabytes of images taken daily from satellites for these rare gravitational lens. First the scientist trained the programs with 6 million fake images depicting gravitational lens and lack of the lens. With this training, the program was able to identify gravitational lens. Petrillo explains a human observer working continuously for a week would only expect to find five or six lens. In comparison a trained AI program was to observe 21,789 images and identify 761 potential candidates in 20 minutes. Humans examine these candidates to reduce to group to 56, and with additional observations resulting in a third becoming legitimate. The AI’s ability to search through vast amounts of images in a short amount of time opens the door for more ground breaking discoveries about the universe around us.

				Iris AI has developed many new advances in recent years. As mentioned in Available Technologies, Iris AI has made great lengths in the technology community. Starting with exploration, Artificial intelligence is changing up the way others can study or investigate utilizing its qualities as an exploration tool. In an estimate of three years, Iris AI plans on transforming into a provocative assistant, to creating different new ideas not previously considered for further research. In ten years, they are expected to announce an AI scientist that can research a body of content, forming a hypothesis, create an experiment in a robotic lab or simulation, and publish its results. Lastly, Iris AI has the potential to train humans as well as other Artificial Intelligence robots. Overall Iris AI has many new up and coming advancements contributing to further research and receiving a better understanding of a new world of Artificial Intelligence.
