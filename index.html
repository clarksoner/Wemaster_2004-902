		        Our Chapter's Highlights
			</p>

			<p class="bodyText1">
				 Our regional chapter believes in playing an active role in the community by demonstrating the values and high expectations we hold. This year at the Homecoming Carnival, our chapter ran a concession stand, providing food and refreshments for the event, along with a game “Doctor Pop-a-Glove”, where participants attempted to pop rubber gloves with darts for a prize. By participating in Relay for Life we set an example for other TSA chapters by encouraging support for the efforts of American Cancer Society. This act also demonstrated to our community what our TSA chapter represents and supports. Techfest brings the community together and rewards students for their hard work and achievements. Our chapter recognizes the importance of encouraging the younger generation to pursue a passion in STEM and therefore we play a major role in organizing, setting up, and assisting the judges. Below is a slideshow which demonstrates each of the following activities and click on the sidebar for more detailed information.

				Artificial Intelligence
			</p>

			<p class="bodyText1">
			        In a world driven by technology, many people confuse terminology and utilize vocab interchangeability when that is simply not the case. In order to fully understand artificial intelligence (AI), one must have a full understanding of the terminology of deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science in which a machine mimics intelligent, human behavior created through complex algorithms. Machine learning is a subset of the broad branch of AI that has the ability to adapt itself based on experience or more data. When looking at available and future applications of AI, many scientists prefer machine learning with its little reliance on human intervention, strengthening the system. Lastly, deep learning is a topic within machine learning. Deep learning is classified as a network of more than three layers or “stacked neural networks”. These layers are made of nodes which replicate the loose pattern of a neuron in the human brain.The node combines given data with coefficients, to control the input, and identifies the corresponding inputs for the assigned task. The sum of these inputs and pass through the activation function to decide the amplitude of the signal in the network to achieve the ultimate outcome.
