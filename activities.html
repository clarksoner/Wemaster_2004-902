Currently, Abigail Reigner holds the position of Treasurer on the officer team. In addition to officer positions, the Boyertown Chapter has received awards recognizing the amount fundraised for the American Cancer Society. The Boyertown Chapter has received the Purple Award for the past two years. This award is given to chapters who have raised above $ 2,000 during the year. The Boyertown Chapter considers this a great honor to be one of the few chapters to be recognized for this great achievement. The Inspiration Award was also awarded to this chapter at the regional and state level. This coveted award recognizes chapters who exemplify TSA ideals of becoming a large role in the community through their service projects and activities. Last year during the Pennsylvania State Conference, boyertown student William Sheeler was awarded Outstanding Technology Student, demonstrating noteworthy achievements and leadership in TSA. Along with the award he received a $1,500 scholarship that he plans on utilizing toward his college education. The Boyertown Chapter not only strives for excellence during competitions but as well as in the community sharing what the Technology Student Association stands for and the leaders we strive to become.
