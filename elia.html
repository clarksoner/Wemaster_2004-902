				Plagiarism checkers must rely on a large database to search thousands of online documents to compare to the students essay but with ELIA Education our AI machine learning has the ability to search sources outside of the database including sources in foreign languages and non-digitized sources.  ELIA Education catches plagiarism with more accuracy and efficiently than other
					online sources making it even easier for teachers to stop plagiarism. With ELIA Education scanner students can simply input their paper into ELIA, who scans their paper in to her program and gives feedback on any errors their essay might have. This takes a heavy weight off of teachers who often feel bogged down and punished when assigning essays due 
					to the chore of reading hundreds of students’ papers within a few weeks. Taking this struggle from the teachers can allow them to focus on what skill students fall short. Lastly, ELIA’s scanner can easily grade multiple choice questions. Not only can she grade these papers but also has the ability to create a different test comprised of topics that students demonstrated
					poor understanding about. This application is a huge benefit for teachers, providing them the opportunity to reteach this topic follow the lesson with a new test that specifically tests their increased understanding with hopefully a higher grade.
