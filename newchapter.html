Andrew Schoph is a new edition to the Boyertown Senior High tech-ed department teaching the new incoming ninth graders, although he has taught at the Junior High. He credits his passion for technology from his teacher in school by making the classes interesting and exciting to learn. Schopf knew straight away when his passion grew that teaching was the best fit. The alternative would be engineering in a small office cubicle for several decades. This was not the future that Schopf desired with his spirited personality. The advice that Mr.Schoph emphasises to all of his students is, “Once the job is first begun, never leave it until it is done. Be the effort great or small, do it well or not at all.”

				The Boyertown Chapter has grown into a well respected chapter in the TSA community. We have had several students hold officer positions on the Pennsylvania officer team.

Currently, Abigail Reigner holds the position of Treasurer on the officer team. In addition to officer positions, the Boyertown Chapter has received awards recognizing the amount fundraised for the American Cancer Society. The Boyertown Chapter has received the Purple Award for the past two years. This award is given to chapters who have raised above $ 2,000 during the year. The Boyertown Chapter considers this a great honor to be one of the few chapters to be recognized for this great achievement. The Inspiration Award was also awarded to this chapter at the regional and state level. This coveted award recognizes chapters who exemplify TSA ideals of becoming a large role in the community through their service projects and activities. Last year during the Pennsylvania State Conference, boyertown student William Sheeler was awarded Outstanding Technology Student, demonstrating noteworthy achievements and leadership in TSA. Along with the award he received a $1,500 scholarship that he plans on utilizing toward his college education.
