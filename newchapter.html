				 Mr. Andrew Schoph is a graduate of Millersville University with a bachelors in Technology Education. He then continued on to Wilkes University to receive his masters degree. Andrew Schoph is a new edition to the Boyertown Senior High tech-ed department teaching the new incoming ninth graders, although he has taught at the Junior High. He credits his passion for technology from his teacher in school by making the classes interesting and exciting to learn. Schopf knew straight away when his passion grew that teaching was the best fit. The alternative would be engineering in a small office cubicle for several decades. This was not the future that Schopf desired with his spirited personality. The advice that Mr.Schoph emphasises to all of his students is, “Once the job is first begun, never leave it until it is done. Be the effort great or small, do it well or not at all.”

				Content goes on pages, isn't that neat?
				<br><br>
				I put images on these pages by default. It's a picture of Mr. Hiryak. To change an image just change the URL in the code, it'll look like src="", just put the URL in the quotation marks.

				More Content

			<p class="bodyText1">
				If you want more content on your pages, just copy paste the text blocks. There are two parts to a text block - the header and the content. They're both surrounded by P tags. You're smart you can figure it out I think.
