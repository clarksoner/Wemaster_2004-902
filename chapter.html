					Biology
				</p>
				<p class="bodyText1">
					Biology is a rigorous introduction to the biological sciences in which the student will explore the basic make-up of living things, how they are put together, carry on life processes, pass characteristics on from one generation to the next, and interact with one another and the environment. This is a laboratory course. A Biology Keystone Exam will be administered at the end of the course; proficiency on the Biology Keystone Exam is a state requirement for the class of 2019 and beyond. 
					Honors Recommendation: ‘A’ average in current science class; teacher recommendation, strong study skills, and motivation to do out-of-class work.
					AP Recommendation: ‘A’ in Biology or a ‘B’ in Honors Biology; Chemistry completed or taken concurrently; or teacher recommendation **This would be based on your AP Biology test score and the accepting post-secondary school’s policy.
